# Reginaldo Spricigo

## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Github profile.

🔭 I'm proud to say that I am currently changing my. For the past six months I've been working directly on systems integrations projects.
</p>
Unfortunately these projects are private, so I can't share the code here. Instead, let’s discuss the main topics involved.
</p>
Project 1 - Integration between a Hospital Information System (HIS) and a healthcare auditing system for billing and insurance authorizations.
</p>
Project 2 - Integration between a HIS and a PACS in order to receive and storage medical reports.
</p>
Project 3 - Integration between a HIS and a partner that automatically sends invoices to a municipal, eliminating the need for manual data entry on the municipality's website and reducing rework.
</p>
Project 4 - Development of an API to provide endpoints serving data to be consumed by an application that displays a status panel for family members, keeping them updated on their relatives' surgical procedures.
</p>
Project 5 - Development of an API to be consumed by an application used by nurses, allowing them to easily update the current stage of a surgery.
</p>

</p>
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Kotlin, so I'll be happy to collaborate on projects or questions about these tecnologies.
